= Preface

== Evaluation license

include::_license_jcp.adoc[]

== Foreword

Desktop|Embedded Application API 1.0 defines a set of APIs for commonly used behavior observed in desktop and embedded
applications written with JVM languages.

== Conventions and Terms

=== Typography

A fixed width, non-serif typeface (`sample`) indicates the term is a Java package, class, interface, or member name. Text written in this typeface is always related to coding.
Emphasis (_sample_) is used the first time an important concept is introduced. Its explanation usually follows directly after the introduction.

=== Key Words

This specification consistently uses the words may, should, and must. Their meaning is well-defined in <<_ref_1,[1]>> _Bradner, S., Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels_. A summary follows.

 * _must_ – An absolute requirement. Both the Framework implementation and bundles have obligations that are required to be fulfilled to conform to this specification.
 * _should_ – Recommended. It is strongly recommended to follow the description, but reasons may exist to deviate from this recommendation.
 * _may_ or _can_ – Optional. Implementations must still be interoperable when these items are not implemented.
